## Selora
A reactive language designed to make the __link__ between frontend and backend not a big pain.  
Allows the direct __hooking__ of events and actions without any boilerplate.  
Makes making __games__ or __UIs__ a *breeze* and no longer absolute hell.  
  
### __Made *by* devs, *for* devs__
